## TAF Generation Project  
  
# Terminal Aerodrome Forecast Generation (Encoded Weather Forecast)  
  
Meant to take in user input (eventually pulling data from files) of weather forecast data and to generate a 24-30 hour forecast in the 
form of a TAF.  
  
# Goal:  
Meant to be a simple portfolio project for personal use and for weather enthusiasts like myself. Forecasts generated will not be meant for 
professional use but for experimental use. This is meant to develop my skill in C/C++ while also maintaining a passion in meteorology. 
  
Will take in:  
1) Wind data  
2) Visibility  
3) Cloud conditions  
4) Altimeter data  
5) Maximum and minimum temperatures  
6) Any icing/turbulence data  
7) Any low level wind shear data  
  
Will store the forecast data the user enters as well as any current observational data. This data will be overwritten everytime the program runs.
